# Task Manager Application

## Code Structure:
### For our project our java classes are in inside the source directory. From there if you open the main directory you will see a java directory which has all of our java code. All of our java files are within the "com.example.task_manager" package.

### We also have a FMXL file called "Main_Display.fxml" that is responsible for displaying the main display. That file is also in the source directory. From there you can go to the resources directory and then to the "com.example.task_manager" package where you will find the file.

## Running Application:

### To run this application you need to run the file called "DisplayApplication" inside the com.example.task_manager package.

## Testing Functional Requirements
## 1. Saving data to database: When you open up the application and click on "New Task, you will be prompted with a new window to enter in a task name, description, category, category color and priority level. Once you fill out that information and click save it will save the data to the database. 
## 2. Loading data from database: After doing the above information, you can restart the application and you'll find that the tasks you created are still there because it's being loaded from the database.
## 3. Displaying tasks to user: When you open up the application and click on one of the 3 priority levels you will see the tasks displayed there. You can also click on these tasks to get more detailed information.
