# Task Manager Application

## Code Structure:
### For our project our java classes are in inside the source directory. From there if you open the main directory you will see a java directory which has all of our java code. All of our java files are within the "com.example.task_manager" package.

### We also have a FMXL file called "Main_Display.fxml" that is responsible for displaying the main display. That file is also in the source directory. From there you can go to the resources directory and then to the "com.example.task_manager" package where you will find the file.

## Running Application:

### To run this application you need to run the file called "DisplayApplication" inside the com.example.task_manager package.
